Last summer, I purchased a product from [notabag](https://www.notabag.com/) to give as a gift. It's a great design, with the convenience of having a spare bag that can fold away into a pocket, but also the comfort to wear it as a backpack so that hands can be free and the contents don't weigh heavily on only one shoulder.

With that in mind, here is my own version of the foldable backpack with letter format printable pattern and assembly notes for my approach to sewing it.
