title: Characterization of quantum confinement in GaAs using photoluminescence spectroscopy 
event: UROP Symposium 2018
event_url:

location: University of Ottawa
address:
  street: 
  city: Ottawa
  region: Ontario
  postcode: 
  country: Canada

summary: Poster presentation on the topic of photoluminescence spectroscopy given during the 2018 Syposium for the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.
abstract: "We compare a bulk gallium arsenide sample with a sample formed of stacked quantum wells to observe the bandgap shift owing to quantum confinement. The observations agree well with the infinite potential well model."
